# Development Notes

- Use camel case for variables.
- Use `clamp()` for font sizes and spacing.
- Use `rem` for font sizes.
- Use `em` for spacing.
- Use `vw` for widths.
- Use `vh` for heights.

- Variables: Use nouns that describe the data, like userAge or totalAmount.
- Functions: Use action words, like calculateTotal() or fetchUserData().
- Classes: Use singular nouns, like User or Order, to represent what they are.

- functions only do one thing and do it well.
- only use comments when absolutely necessary.
- indent with 4 spaces man!
- dont hardcode shit
- lets use config files
